# Standalone Vue Project talking to ASP.NET Core

See issue - https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/38861

I read this from Scott Hanselman  - https://www.hanselman.com/blog/javascript-and-typescript-projects-with-react-angular-or-vue-in-visual-studio-2022-with-or-without-net

But I do not develop on windows or with visual studio 2022. I can't find any resources on how to do this via the dotnet cli or vscode so I have spun up a windows box and am going through the tutorial below to try and work out how to make it work for us non windows non visual studio folk.

This was the full tutorial I followed:
